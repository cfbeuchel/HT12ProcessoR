used_in	variable	value	explanation
importData	file_names_of_files_and_folders	path/to/dir	Table with columns  'processing_batch', fileset_id 'nobkgd_f', 'con_f', 'sample_f', reporting on filenames including path of raw-data files from GenomeStudio
importData	renameDublettes	TRUE	If any sample Ids is found more than once, add suffixes .1 .2 etc to the new_ID of respective samples
importData	prefix_new_samplename	s_	Prefix of new_ID, the new R-compatibel sample names
importData, createExpressionSet	colseparator	.	Separator splitting numbers into units of 1000. Typically . or  ,
filterLowExpressed	filter1ind_expressedGenes	3	Filter for extreme number of 'Detected.Genes..0.01.' at detection p-value 0.01. Valid is: 'Detected.Genes..0.01.' < Median - [value]x IQR AND > Median - [value]x IQR
filterLowExpressed	filter1probes_expressedProbes	0.05	Attribute assigning an expression probe as 'expressed' if detected within at least [value]x n(individuals) at detection p-value 0.05
transformNormalizeHT12object, removeBatchEffects	normalisation_method	quantile	Method used for normalisation. Either 'quantile' (quantile normalisation) or 'rsn' (robust spline normalisation)
filterTechnicallyFailed	filter2ind_atypischIlmnKontroll	4	Filter for extreme combination of Illuminas control features summarized as Mahalanobis distance. Valid is ln('Mahalanobis distance') < median(ln('Mahalanobis distance')) + [value] *  IQR(ln('Mahalanobis distance'))
filterTechnicallyFailed	controlparameters2check	hybrid_low, hybrid_med,  string_pm, string_mm, biotin, negative	Illuminas control features used for calculation of the Mahalanobis distance based outlyer criterium. Default ist 'hybrid_low, hybrid_med,  string_pm, string_mm, biotin, negative' (if spiked in erccc is used in ALL CHIPS use also 'ercc_1, ercc_2, ercc_3, ercc_4, ercc_5', if spked in artificial polyadenylated RNAs from Bacillus subtilis immediately preceding the reverse transcription step is used, also 'labeling'). In case of population based studies within a single tissue default is also 'housekeeping, Detected.Genes..0.01.'.
filterTechnicallyFailed	robustmethod_for_mahal	MVE	Method used for calculation of robust correllation for Mahalanobis distance within function mdqc(). Previous default was S-estimator (which has a 25% breakdown point), now MVE is prefferred (i.e. the Minimum Volume Ellipsoid (MVE) which searches for the ellipsoid with the smallest volume that covers h data points). Alternative is MCD (i.e. the Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD) estimator which looks for the subset of h data points whose covariance matrix has the smallest determinant)
removeBatchEffects	excludeERCC	TRUE	exclude ERCC samples from following steps, default ist FALSE
removeBatchEffects	save_subgroupcontrast	FALSE	protect subgroup contrast from beeing affected in batch ajdustment, CAVE risk of false positives when subgroups are unbalanced with batches. Default is FALSE
removeBatchEffects, filter4MinBatchsize	second_combat_withvar		Do an additional 2nd combat adjiustment with the stated variabel. If " (default), no 2nd combat will be done.
removeBatchEffects	additional_normalisation_after_combat	FALSE	Indicator (TRUE or FALSE), whether to normalize data after batch-correction with Combat using method specified in 'normalisation_method'
removeBatchEffects	ComBat_adjust_covariates	FALSE	Add covariates provided in 'ComBat_covariates_to_adjust' to design matrix of sva::ComBat, i.e. adjust the model for these covariates
removeBatchEffects	ComBat_covariates_to_adjust		When ComBat_adjust_covariates == TRUE, these columns in $chipsamples will be added as covariates in the sva::ComBat model
filterAtypicalExpressed, visualizePreprocessing.R	filter2ind_atypischEuklid	4	Filter for extreme combination of values from expressed transcripts summarized as Euclidian distance of expression values of all expression probes previously classified as expressed and non-overinflated regarding ANOVA on batch-effects.  Valid is ln('Euclidian distance') < median(ln('Euclidian Distance' )) + [value] *  IQR(ln('Euclidian Distance' ))
visualizePreprocessing	show_qcplots_individSamplelevel	TRUE	Show QC plots comparing expression values before / after preprocessing either binned on SentrixID ('FALSE') or binned on Sample ID ('TRUE')?
writeFilesTosend	datafolder_results		Directory, where the results of preprocessing can be stored
writeFilesTosend	file_sampleannot_final.txt	sampleannot_HT12v4.txt	Filename for sample-related attributes after finished preprocessing
writeFilesTosend	file_probeannot_final.txt	probeannot_HT12v4.txt	Filename for expression probe-related attributes after finished preprocessing
writeFilesTosend	file_annot_final.xlsx	sampleUNDprobeannot_HT12v4.xlsx	Filename for an excel file combining 'file_sampleannot_final.txt' and 'file_probeannot_final.txt'.
writeFilesTosend	file_final_expression_set	expressionset_preprocessed.Rdata	Filename of expression set  after finished preprocessing
writeFilesTosend	file_final_expression_matrix	expressionmatrix_preprocessed.Rdata	Filename of expression matrix as R object after finished preprocessing
writeFilesTosend	file_all_transcripts_good_incl_remapping_ok	all_transcripts_good_incl_remapping_ok.txt	Filename where probes are listed that are classified as expressed, not over-inflated for batch effects and classified at least 'good' according to remapping on the human genome as described in Nucleic Acids Res. Januar 2010;38(3):e17.  in ALL user-provided subgroups
writeFilesTosend	file_final_expression_matrix_allProbes.txt	expressionmatrix_preprocessed.txt	Filename of expression matrix as tab delimited text file after finished preprocessing
writeFilesTosend	file_renaming_samples_tosend		Filename where a column named `oldname` and `newname` is provided in order to rename samples, column oldname must match the names of the sample in column new_ID  in the `chipsamples` data.frame. Can be empty if no renaming is required
